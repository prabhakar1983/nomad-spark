# DEPRECATED

__The Nomad Spark integration is deprecated and will no longer be maintained by
HashiCorp__. Spark lacks a pluggable scheduler interface, necessitating this
independent fork. Maintaining this fork requires significant effort to keep
current with upstream Spark, persisting correct behavior of our integration while
tracking Spark's constantly-advancing feature set. Ultimately, we felt that the
level of effort did not justify the result: a second-class Spark experience
inconsistent with HashiCorp standards.

The Nomad team continues to be excited about the future of our ecosystem. Weâ€™re
currently focusing our efforts on building first-class experiences, with
features such as autoscaling and integrations with Spinnaker and Airflow on the
horizon. As always, feel free to reach out on our discussion forums at
